RASPBERRY PI 5

This file gives information about the Raspberry Pi 5 support in Circle.


FEATURES

Currently is only a small subset of features supported:

* System init and reboot
* MMU and cache support
* Memory allocation (with 3 GB high memory max. so far)
* Property mailbox (subset of functions only)
* ActLED
* GIC interrupt controller (IRQ only)
* 1 UART (via UART connector, including IRQ support)
* Framebuffer and screen device
* PCIe host bridge to RP1 device (no IRQ support so far)
* GPIO at RP1 (40-pin header) (subset of methods, input/output only)
* Multi-core support and spin locks
* Hardware random number generator
* Scheduler library
* Bootloader (via UART connector)

Most external hardware interfaces (GPIO, I2C etc.) are part of the RP1
southbridge and are not supported yet.

The Cortex-A76 CPU of the Raspberry Pi 5 supports only AArch64 in the mode,
which is used by Circle (EL1), so AArch32 is and will not be supported.


BUILDING

The *Config.mk* for the Raspberry Pi 5 looks like this:

	AARCH = 64
	RASPPI = 5
	PREFIX64 = aarch64-none-elf-
	DEFINE += -DARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE	# optional

It can be created using:

	./configure -r 5 [ --multicore ]

Build the base library using:

	cd lib
	make

Optionally build the scheduler library using:

	cd lib/sched
	make

Go to the sample directory of your choice (see below) and enter:

	make


INSTALLING

The resulting kernel image file has the name kernel_2712.img. Additionally the
following files are required on the SD card:

* bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb (can be downloaded in boot/)
* config.txt (copy boot/config64.txt and rename it)


SAMPLES

Currently the following sample programs are operational:

* 01-gpiosimple (no audio clicks)
* 02-screenpixel
* 03-screentext
* 04-timer
* 17-fractal (multi-core supported)
* 19-tasks (requires scheduler library)
* 24-hwrandom

Additionally the following tests in test/ are operational:

* gpio
