RASPBERRY PI 5

This file gives information about the Raspberry Pi 5 support in Circle.


FEATURES

Currently is only a small subset of features supported:

* System init and reboot
* MMU and cache support
* Memory allocation (with 3 GB high memory max. so far)
* Property mailbox (subset of functions only)
* ActLED
* GIC interrupt controller (IRQ only)
* 1 UART (via UART connector, including IRQ support)
* Framebuffer and screen device
* PCIe host bridge to RP1 device
* GPIO at RP1 (40-pin header) (subset of methods, input/output only)
* GPIO interrupts (via RP1, issue with GPIOInterruptOn[Rising|Falling]Edge)
* First xHCI USB controller (with 2 ports)
* Multi-core support and spin locks
* Hardware random number generator
* Watchdog device
* Scheduler library
* Sound library (with USB sound only)
* Bootloader (via UART connector)

Most external hardware interfaces (I2C etc.) are not supported yet.

The Cortex-A76 CPU of the Raspberry Pi 5 supports only AArch64 in the mode,
which is used by Circle (EL1), so AArch32 is and will not be supported.


BUILDING

The *Config.mk* for the Raspberry Pi 5 looks like this:

	AARCH = 64
	RASPPI = 5
	PREFIX64 = aarch64-none-elf-
	DEFINE += -DARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE	# optional

It can be created using:

	./configure -r 5 [ --multicore ]

Build all supported libraries using:

	./makeall5 [ -j ]

Go to the sample directory of your choice (see below) and enter:

	make


INSTALLING

The resulting kernel image file has the name kernel_2712.img. Additionally the
following files are required on the SD card:

* bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb (can be downloaded in boot/)
* config.txt (copy boot/config64.txt and rename it)


SAMPLES

Currently the following sample programs are operational:

* 01-gpiosimple (no audio clicks)
* 02-screenpixel
* 03-screentext
* 04-timer
* 08-usbkeyboard
* 17-fractal (multi-core supported)
* 19-tasks
* 24-hwrandom
* 34-sounddevices (USB sound only)

Additionally the following tests in test/ are operational:

* gpio
* gpio-interrupt
* watchdog

USB

Currently only two USB ports can be used (view onto the ports):

+---------+---------+
|         | Port 1  |
|         | USB 2.0 |
|         | only    |
+---------+---------+
| Port 2  |         |
| USB 2.0 |         |
| USB 3.0 |         |
