README

This test program works with ILI9341- or ST7789-based touchscreens with the
XPT2046 touch controller. Its a modified version of the sample/28-touchscreen.
See its README for more info!

You have to update the configuration in addon/display/sampleconfig.h and in
kernel.cpp and have to build addon/display/libdisplay.a before you can build
this test.
