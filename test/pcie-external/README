README

This test program is only working on the Raspberry Pi 5, which features an
external PCIe connector. The program displays the first 16 32-bit words of the
(outbound) PCIe memory of the attached PCIe device.

Before build you have to set the slot and function number of PCIe device
(normally 0/0) and its 24-bit class code in the file kernel.cpp.

The program has been tested with the Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+ and a 256 GB
Raspberry Pi NVMe device.
