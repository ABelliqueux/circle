README

This sample is a multi-core program, which displays different applications
(LVGL demo, 2D graphics, fractal calculation, terminal) in 4 different windows
on the screen. It does not run on Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero.

Before building it, you must enable the multi-core support (system option
ARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE) in the file Config.mk. After building the main Circle
libraries also the library in addon/lvgl/ has to be built, before this sample
can be built.

You should attach a standard USB mouse to be able to control the LVGL demo in
the top left window.
