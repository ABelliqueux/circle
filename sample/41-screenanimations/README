README

This example shows 32 various graphical shapes moving on screen without
flickering or screen tearing. You can create a file cmdline.txt like this on the
SD(HC) card to change the frame buffer size:

width=640 height=480

This example can be used on a ST7789 SPI display too. For it you have to update
the display configuration in the file st7789config.h and must enable the
following definition in the Makefile before build:

USE_ST7789 = 1

You have to build the library in addon/display/ before build.
