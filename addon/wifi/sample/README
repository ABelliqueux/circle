README

This sample uses the on-board Wi-Fi device of the Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and Zero W
to connect to a Wi-Fi network and to update the system time from a NTP server.
Currently only WPA2 enabled Wi-Fi networks can be joined by default. The Wi-Fi
driver has been ported from the Plan 9 operating system. Furthermore the ported
"WPA Supplicant" tool is used.

Before build you have to fetch to submodule addon/wifi/hostap with the following
command:

	git submodule update --init addon/wifi/hostap

Beside the main Circle libraries the library in addon/fatfs/ is needed and must
be made, before the wifi libraries and the sample can be built with:

	cd addon/wifi
	./makeall

You have to provide the following firmware files for the different Wi-Fi
controllers of the Raspberry Pi:

	brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt
	brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.clm_blob
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt

These files can be downloaded as follows (uses the "wget" tool):

	cd addon/wifi/firmware
	make

These files must be copied into the directory /firmware of an USB flash drive
(with FAT partition). These downloaded firmware files have been tested with
Circle. This drive must be connected to your Raspberry Pi, which is used for the
test. Please note that reading the firmware files from the SD card is currently
not supported.

Furthermore a configuration file "wpa_supplicant.conf" is required in the root
directory of the USB flash drive. You can modify the template file in this
sample directory and set the SSID and password of your own WLAN. The alpha2
ISO/IEC code of the country, where you are in, must be set too.

Please note that two attempts may be needed to connect a WLAN, which can take up
to 30 seconds.
