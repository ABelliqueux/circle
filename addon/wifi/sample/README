README

This sample uses the on-board Wi-Fi device of the Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and Zero W
to connect to a Wi-Fi network and to update the system time from a NTP server.
Currently only open Wi-Fi networks (without authentication) can be joined. The
Wi-Fi driver has been ported from the Plan 9 operating system.

You have to update the ESSID of your Wi-Fi network in kernel.cpp before build.
Beside the main Circle libraries and the wifi library, the library in
addon/fatfs/ is needed and must be made, before the sample can be built.

You have to provide the following firmware files for the different Wi-Fi
controllers of the Raspberry Pi:

	brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt
	brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.clm_blob
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt

These files can be found in the directory /lib/firmware/brcm of a Raspbian
distribution and must be copied into the directory /firmware of an USB flash
drive (with FAT partition). This drive must be connected to your Raspberry Pi,
which is used for the test. Please note that reading the firmware files from the
SD card is currently not supported.

This is a development version of the driver and sample, which has known issues.
