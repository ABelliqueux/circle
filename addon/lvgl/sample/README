README

	For ST7789 support see below.

This sample program demonstrates some features of the LVGL embedded GUI
library v9.2.0 ((c) 2021 LVGL Kft):

	https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl
	https://lvgl.io

The program can be controlled with an USB mouse, with the official Raspberry
Pi touch screen or with some USB HID-class digitizer touch screens and is
itself only a wrapper, which uses the LVGL widgets demo program.

To build the sample you have to clone the LVGL project first, which is included
as Git sub-module into Circle. To do this, just enter:

	git submodule update --init addon/lvgl/lvgl

First build the Circle libraries from Circle project root, then the LVGL library
by entering "make" in the addon/lvgl/ directory. Finally the sample can be built
with "make" in addon/lvgl/sample/.

Please note that the system generates log messages on screen, when an USB mouse
is connected, while the program is running. This destroys the displayed GUI. To
prevent this, you should add the following option to the file cmdline.txt to
direct the log output to the serial interface:

	logdev=ttyS1


This sample can be used on a ST7789 SPI display too. For it you have to update
the display configuration in the file st7789config.h and must enable the
following definition in the Makefile before build:

	USE_ST7789 = 1

You have to build the library in addon/display/ before build too.
